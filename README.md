# Mutational-Dotplot
The SARS-Cov-2 mutational dot plot script helps identify the periods in which certain mutations of interest have emerged and continue to appear. The script inputs an output variant calling file containng mutations and then identifies those that have emerged in more than 1% of the total sequences from the variant calling file. Mutational dot is intended as a post-processing step after trimming and variant calling. To ensure reproducibility of results, we have provided a variant calling output file (Dataset-Amino-Acid-Mutations.csv) and metadata file (SARS-COV-2 analysis.xlsx) containing site names were sampling occurred, in this repository.
